# Posts-Takehome
This is my side-GitHub. My main GitHub is https://github.com/xylarshayu.

Takehome assignment about Nuxt.js. Refer to `./nuxt-app/README.md` for setup instructions. Deployed on: [ToDo].

This project will display posts fetched from the https://dummyjson.com/posts API. The route `/posts` will list posts, and `/posts/:id` will display all information about a single post. Posts will be cached for 15 minutes.

A pinia store will be used for modular handling of all post fetching logic.
